        <p1> Imagine a serene lakeside nestled amidst rolling hills. The lake, crystal clear and shimmering under the gentle caress of the sun, reflects the azure sky above like a flawless mirror. Tall, slender trees line the shore, their emerald leaves rustling softly in the breeze. A family of ducks glides gracefully across the water, leaving delicate ripples in their wake. Nearby, a wooden dock stretches out into the lake, inviting visitors to sit and soak in the peaceful atmosphere.</p1>
            <br><br>
        <p2>On the horizon, distant mountains rise majestically, their peaks dusted with a hint of snow even in the warmth of summer. A meadow nearby blooms with a riot of wildflowers in every color imaginable, painting the landscape with vibrant hues. Butterflies flit from blossom to blossom, adding a touch of whimsy to the idyllic scene.</p2>
        <br><br>
        <p3>As evening approaches, the sky transforms into a canvas of pastel shades â€“ soft pinks, oranges, and purples blending seamlessly with the fading blue. The air is filled with the gentle hum of insects and the occasional call of a bird returning to its nest. It's a scene of tranquility and natural beauty, where time seems to slow down, allowing one to appreciate the simple yet profound wonders of the natural world.</p3>

        <h2>NIKOLA TESLA</h2><br><br>
        <div align="justify">
        <p1>Nikola Tesla was a pioneering inventor and electrical engineer who lived from 1856 to 1943. He was born in Serbia and later became a naturalized American citizen. Tesla is best known for his contributions to the development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems, which revolutionized the transmission and distribution of electricity. His inventions and discoveries also include the Tesla coil, which is still used in radio technology today, and early work on wireless communication and electricity transmission.</p1>
        <br><br>
        <p2> Despite his brilliance, Tesla faced numerous challenges throughout his career, including financial difficulties and disputes with other inventors like Thomas Edison. He was known for his eccentricities and visionary ideas, such as wireless power transmission and the development of a "world system" of energy distribution.</p2>
        <br><br>
        <p3> Tesla's legacy extends beyond his inventions; he left a lasting impact on science and technology, inspiring generations of inventors and engineers. Today, he is revered as one of the greatest minds of the electrical age, with his name immortalized in the unit of magnetic flux density, the "tesla."</p3>
